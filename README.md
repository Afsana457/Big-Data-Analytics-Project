## ðŸ”¹ Part A: Data Cleaning (Python)  
Performed comprehensive preprocessing to ensure clean, consistent data:  
1. Removed duplicate TransactionIDs.  
2. Handled missing values in CustomerID, ProductID, and PaymentMethod.  
3. Standardized categories: Gender, Country, PaymentMethod.  
4. Fixed outliers in Age, Quantity, and UnitPrice.  
5. Converted Discount into numeric percentages (0â€“100).  
6. Recalculated TotalAmount = Quantity Ã— UnitPrice Ã— (1 â€“ Discount).  
7. Standardized PurchaseDate (YYYY-MM-DD) and extracted Year, Month, Weekday.

## ðŸ”¹ Part B: Tableau Dashboards  
Built interactive dashboards to explore key insights:  

- **Sales Dashboard**  
  - Sales by Country (map)  
  - Monthly Sales Trend (line chart)  
  - Top 10 Products by Revenue (bar chart)  

- **Customer Dashboard**  
  - Sales by Gender  
  - Sales by Age Group  

- **Profitability Dashboard**  
  - Effect of Discount on Sales  
  - Top Customers (Pareto 80/20 rule)

## ðŸ”¹ Part C: Power BI Dashboards  
Designed business-focused BI report with:  

- **Card Visuals**: Total Sales, Total Quantity Sold  
- **Charts**: Sales by Category, Monthly Sales, Sales by Gender, Sales by Age Group, Sales by Country  
- **Interactive Slicers**: Year and Product Category

## ðŸš€ Key Insights  
- **Discounts** increase sales but reduce profitability when overused.  
- **Pareto principle (80/20)** holds true: a small group of customers drive the majority of revenue.  
- **Country & Gender analysis** show diverse buying patterns, useful for targeted marketing.
